          vorarlberg.speakerinnen.org is a project to prevent "manels",
          i.e. podiums, committees or panels that are predominantly occupied by men.
          Through the cooperation with <a href='https://speakerinnen.org', target='_blank'>speakerinnen.org</a>
          Vorarlberg women* become visible as experts, speakers and representatives of this region.
          They can be found both locally and internationally.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project is made possible by the <a href='https://vorarlberg.at/frauen', target='_blank'>Funktionsbereich Frauen und Gleichstellung</a>
          im Amt der Vorarlberger Landesregierung and the <a href='https://www.vorarlberg-chancenreich.at/', target='_blank'>Marke Vorarlberg</a>.

              Speakerinnen.org aims to increase the visibility and participation of women at (but not limited to) conferences, panels and talk shows.<br>
              Organizers and hosts can find experts, who gladly (and competently) share their knowledge. <br>
              women can register in our database with the topics they are interested in covering, and can add references to their abilities.
